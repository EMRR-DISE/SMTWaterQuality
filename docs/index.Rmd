## Daily average turbidities

This is a summary of daily average turbidity for several stations in the Delta.

```{r stations}

```

## Here is the average turbidity for the past 7 days


```{r pressure, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

turb = cdec_query(c("BDL", "RVB"), 27, duration = "E",
                  start.date = today()-7, end.date = today())

turb2 = mutate(turb, Date = date(DateTime)) %>%
  group_by(Date, StationID) %>%
  summarize(Turbidity = mean(Value, na.rm =T))

ggplot(turb2, aes(x = Date, y = Turbidity)) + geom_line()+geom_point()+
  facet_wrap(~StationID)+
  geom_text(aes(label = round(Turbidity, 1)), nudge_y = 5)
